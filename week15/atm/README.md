# ATM Exercise in React
Simulates depositing and withdrawing from an account, and associated logic, in React

![Screenshot of a fictious ATM](demo.png)

## Description of the project
Keeps track of the balance of a fictious bank account, allowing you to deposit and withdraw to and from it. The account balance, deposit/withdrawal amount, and transaction validity are all managed states in React. Rudimentary logic checks the validity of a transaction (you can't withdraw more than you have) and disables form submissions accordingly.

## How to Run
Download all files then launch index.html as an http-server

## Roadmap of future improvements
Nice next steps include:

- Confirmations for the user when transactions are completed
- Improved styling and CSS for the different operating modes (deposit, withdrawal)
