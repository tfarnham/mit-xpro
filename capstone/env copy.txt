Shown below inside the triple quotes is an example of the contents of a .env file. 
This is the file which provides the environmental variables used in docker-compose.yml.
In order to correctly dockerize the app, you will need to create your own .env file and paste in these contents.
Note: you will need to create your own Strapi and Mongodb credentials and update the file with those rather than using the ones from the video.
